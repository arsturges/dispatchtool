<h2>About the Demand Response Dispatch Tool</h2>
<p>Demand Response (DR) resources play an important role in transmission and 
capacity expansion modeling and in integrated resource planning. 
DR resources have the ability to reduce system peak load and/or shift load 
from system peak to other times in the day. 
This peak reduction and peak shifting may reduce the need to build new generation 
and transmission, reducing costs and providing environmental benefits.</p>

<p>The Demand Response Dispatch Tool (DRDT) was developed by Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory (LBNL) to create load modifying profiles of Demand Response 
(DR) resources for use by regional transmission planners in the Western Interconnect. 
The DRDT uses DR resource availability and price information to develop a realistic 
dispatch approach for economic DR resources. 
The DRDT was initially created to develop inputs to PROMOD, a production cost model, 
but the load modifying profiles can be used more widely by other production cost 
and planning models.</p>

<h3>How does The Demand Response Dispatch Tool work?</h3>
<p>The Demand Response Dispatch Tool (DRDT) works by dispatching demand 
response resources during high-price hours or high-load hours according 
to resource availability. At a high level, the DRDT first characterizing a 
resource in terms of its program attributes, and then utilizes that resource 
in a resource-planning context with respect to its characteristics.</p>

<p>The DRDT uses 8760 price and load profiles&mdash;provided the user&mdash;
subject to program-specific constraints (e.g. expected hours of dispatch per 
program per year). Demand response resources are available in relationship </p> 

<p>The availability of DR programs varies by month and by hour, for some programs. 
It is important to capture this availability in the modeling of DR resources, in 
order to ensure DR programs typically used during system peak months and hours 
are not utilized at full availability in non-system-peak months and hours.</p>

<h3>What is a dispatchable demand response resource?</h3>
<div class="row">
    <div class="span4">
        <p>A demand response resource refers to any reductiong in electric load. 
        The DRDT models dispatchable response programs which are capable of 
        reducting load in response to dispatch signals. 
        These signals come from the grid operator in real-time. 
        The demand response resources used in the DRDT are based on NERC-definitions 
        of dispatchable demand response resources.</p>

        <p>The user provides the maximum monthly demand response resource size. 
        For example, in August 2012 the maximum demand response resource might by 
        100 megawatts. Internally, the DRDT uses calculates based on the annual 
        peak load how much of that total potential demand response resource is 
        actually available to reduce load. For example, if the annual peak load 
        was 4000 megawatts and the current load is 2000 megawatts, then only 50% 
        of the 100 megawatts of the demand response resource is actually available 
        to reduce load. The other 50% is not active, and so can't be reduced.</p>

<h3>What is a demand response program?</h3>
<p>The demand response programs modeled in the DRDT include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pricing with controls</li>
    <li>Diect load control</li>
    <li>Load as a capacity resource</li>
    <li>Interruptible</li>
