<h2>Algorithm Properties</h2>
<h4>DispatchProperty_A</h4>
<p>This property controls how the algorithm decides
to slice up the time to get the best dispatches.</p>
<ol>
    <li>PeakHour: Under this scheme, the algorithm looks for the most
    extreme peaks during the year and then makes programs so that they
    straddle the worst peaks in the optimal ways.</li>
    <li>PeakPeriod: In this scheme, the algorithm looks for the highest
    n-hour periods for each day and assigns dispatch to the highest.</li>
</ol>

<h4>DispatchProperty_B</h4>
<p>This property controls the population that is to be used.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Boolean: this is 1 if the program has dr to dispatch and 0 if not.</li>
    <li>Maximum: This returns the maximum amount of DR that can be
dispatched.  This is the value found in the ReferenceDR file.</li>
    <li>Expected: This returns the expected amount of megawatts that will
be dispatched.  This equals the maximum amount multiplied by the
expected-usage "shape" fraction.</li>
</ol>
<h4>DispatchProperty_C</h4>
<p>This property controls the quantity the algorithm is optimizing.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Price: This will cause the algorithm to convert the megawatts of
dispatch into prices, by multiplying by the LMP.</li>
    <li>Power: this will cause the algorithm to leave the dispatch amounts
in their megawatt form.</li>
</ol>
