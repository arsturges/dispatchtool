<h2>Algorithm Properties</h2>
<h4>DispatchProperty_A</h4>
<p>This property controls how the algorithm decides
to slice up the time to get the best dispatches.</p>
<ol>
    <li>PeakHour: Under this scheme, the algorithm looks for the most
    extreme peaks during the year and then makes programs so that they
    straddle the worst peaks in the optimal ways.</li>
    <li>PeakPeriod: In this scheme, the algorithm looks for the highest
    n-hour periods for each day and assigns dispatch to the highest.</li>
</ol>

<h4>DispatchProperty_B</h4>
<p>This property controls the population that is to be used.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Boolean: this is 1 if the program has dr to dispatch and 0 if not.</li>
    <li>Maximum: This returns the maximum amount of DR that can be
dispatched.  This is the value found in the ReferenceDR file.</li>
    <li>Expected: This returns the expected amount of megawatts that will
be dispatched.  This equals the maximum amount multiplied by the
expected-usage "shape" fraction.</li>
</ol>
<h4>DispatchProperty_C</h4>
<p>This property controls the quantity the algorithm is optimizing.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Price: This will cause the algorithm to convert the megawatts of
dispatch into prices, by multiplying by the LMP.</li>
    <li>Power: this will cause the algorithm to leave the dispatch amounts
in their megawatt form.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Text from Nathan</h3>

<p>The Demand Response Dispatch Tool (DRDT) works by constructing a curve 
that represents various quantities. It is against this curve it decides what 
the "high" and "low" periods against which to dispatch are.</p>

<p>Overall, those quantities are the kW of energy being used by the grid, the 
cost of the kW of energy being used by the grid, and the unit cost of the 
energy being used by the grid.</p>

<p>Next, two very distinct strategies are chosen for assigning DR 
dispatch -- flexibly or inflexibly. In the inflexible approach, each 
program is considered so that each program is called X times with each 
call being some continuous block of Y hours.  No program can be called more 
than once per day. In the flexible approach, each program can be called for 
X*Y 1 hour blocks.  No one program can be called more than once in an hour, 
and no program can be called more than Y times in a day.</p>

<p>Finally, in the inflexible approach, two modes of operation are possible.
In the first, the DR periods to use are calculated as the highest averages - 
so that a 4 hour program would look at 4-hour average periods when describing 
which to assign to (PeakPeriod).  In the second, the DR periods are assigned to 
contain the highest individual hours of the year, and started at the hour that 
maximizes the DR reduction given that.</p>
